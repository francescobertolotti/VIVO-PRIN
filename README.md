# **VIVO Ontology - PRIN customization**

### **What is VIVO**

VIVO is an ontology developed to represent the entire domain of academic research. The primary purpose of VIVO is to make a knowledge-based representation of the assortment of actors and activities taking place across the university's world as well as to support scholars' networking.

### Why we customized it

The ontology was customized in the context of a publicly funded project "of national interest" in Italy (PRIN), titled "The effects of evaluation on academic research: knowledge production and methodological issues". Its general purpose is that of investigating the effects of the research evaluation system implemented so far by the Italian government. The background hypothesis of this PRIN is that this system has effects on the research activity of universities and the production of knowledge: there is some sort of feedback loop between the research system and the system aimed at evaluating the research system. On this basis, the project addresses several research questions, and among them the epistemological and methodological underpinnings of research evaluation systems and their implications for the assessment of the activities of individuals.

### How we customized VIVO

The customization activity followed the following process:

1. we removed entities considered not relevant for the evaluation of the quality of the research (for example, librarians and cities);
2. we removed entities considered not relevant to model the Italian scenario (for ex-ample, professor emeritus and US citizen);
3. we added entities considered relevant for the evaluation of the quality of the re-search, especially in the Italian scenario (for example, the research platforms and the research mindset).
